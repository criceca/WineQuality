# WineQuality

This project analyzes wine quality using a dataset of chemical characteristics.

## Objectives

- Analyze the chemical characteristics of wine.
- Determine which characteristics most influence wine quality.
- Build a predictive model for wine quality.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains the following characteristics:

- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulfates
- Alcohol
- Quality (target variable)

## Execution

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `Wine_quality.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the analysis and build the model.

## Results

The results of the analysis and the predictive model are detailed in the `Wine_quality.ipynb` notebook.
